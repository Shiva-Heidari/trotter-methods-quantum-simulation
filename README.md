Quantum simulation of spin chains using Trotter-Suzuki decomposition methods (1st- and 2nd-order), built with Python and NumPy/Scipy.

# Trotter Methods for Quantum Simulation

This repository explores **Trotter-Suzuki decomposition** for simulating the quantum dynamics of **spin chains**, specifically the **1D transverse-field Ising model (TFIM)**.

We implement both:
-  **First-order Trotter approximation**
- **Second-order (Strang splitting)**
- Comparison to exact unitary evolution
- Fidelity tracking between methods

All code is written in **pure Python**, using `NumPy` and `SciPy` â€” no Qiskit required.
